# MeXE402 - Mechatronics Engineering Elective 2: Data Science and Machine Learning 
## Pair-Based Midterm Project - Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of two fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** used for predictive modeling.

- **Linear Regression** is employed to predict continuous outcomes by establishing a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression** is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome, typically for categorizing data into distinct classes.

The project is divided into two parts, each addressing different datasets and objectives.

## Dataset Description

### 1. **Stock Price Data of Apple Inc. (Linear Regression)**:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset 
   - This dataset contains historical stock prices of Apple Inc., including variables such as `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, and `Volume`.
   - **Objective**: The aim of the linear regression analysis is to predict future stock prices of Apple Inc. based on the available historical data.

### 2. **Iris Flower Classification Dataset (Logistic Regression)**:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
   - This is a classic dataset that includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: `Sepal Length`, `Sepal Width`, `Petal Length`, and `Petal Width`.
   - Each sample is categorized into one of three Iris-species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.
   - **Objective**: The logistic regression analysis aims to classify each iris flower sample into its respective species based on its features.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Linear Regression Analysis**:
   - Predict future stock market prices of Apple Inc. using historical price data (e.g., open, close, high, low, and volume).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.

2. **Logistic Regression Analysis**:
   - Classify iris flowers into one of the three species using their physical characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
   - Assess the performance of the classification model using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.

By the end of this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of both linear and logistic regression in real-world scenarios, from predicting stock prices to classifying biological species.
